## Problem Statement

### AppLocker DLL Extraction Issues

In enterprise environments with AppLocker enabled, .NET applications published as single-file executables may encounter permission issues when attempting to extract embedded DLLs to temporary directories. This typically manifests as:

- **Access Denied Errors**: Applications fail to extract DLLs to user temp folders
- **Startup Failures**: Applications crash during initialization due to missing dependencies
- **Security Policy Violations**: AppLocker blocks DLL extraction to non-whitelisted locations

### Traditional Approaches and Limitations

- **Whitelisting temp directories**: Security risk and difficult to manage
- **Running with elevated permissions**: Not always feasible in enterprise environments
- **Disabling single-file publishing**: Increases deployment complexity

## Solution Overview

WebConnect addresses these issues by:

1. **Pre-extracting DLLs**: Simulating the extraction process during build time
2. **Controlled Extraction Path**: Using a configurable, AppLocker-friendly extraction directory
3. **Packaging Extracted DLLs**: Including extracted dependencies in deployment packages
4. **Runtime Redirection**: Configuring the .NET runtime to use the pre-approved extraction path

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variable

The DLL extraction feature relies on the `DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR` environment variable:

```powershell
# Set the environment variable (adjust path as needed)
$env:DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR = "C:\temp\WebConnect\extracted"

# For persistent configuration (system-wide)
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR", "C:\temp\WebConnect\extracted", "Machine")

# For persistent configuration (user-specific)
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR", "C:\temp\WebConnect\extracted", "User")
```

### Choosing the Extraction Path

Consider these factors when selecting an extraction path:

- **Write Permissions**: Ensure the application has write access to the directory
- **AppLocker Compatibility**: Choose a path that's whitelisted in AppLocker policies
- **Disk Space**: Ensure sufficient space for extracted DLLs (typically 50-100 MB)
- **Path Length**: Keep path under 248 characters to avoid Windows limitations

### Recommended Paths

| Environment | Recommended Path | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Development | `C:\temp\WebConnect\extracted` | Easy to access and debug |
| Production (CyberArk PSM) | `C:\Program Files (x86)\CyberArk\PSM\Components\WebConnect` | Standard PSM component location |
| Generic Enterprise | `C:\ProgramData\WebConnect\extracted` | Accessible to all users |
| User-specific | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WebConnect\extracted` | Per-user isolation |

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Build with DLL Extraction

```powershell
# Basic build (uses default extraction simulation)
.\publish.ps1 -Version "1.0.0"

# Build with specific configuration
.\publish.ps1 -Version "1.1.0" -Configuration Release -RuntimeIdentifier win-x64
```

### Build Process Steps

The build script automatically performs the following steps:

1. **Environment Validation**: Checks for .NET SDK and required tools
2. **Version Management**: Updates project version numbers
3. **Dependency Restoration**: Downloads and caches NuGet packages
4. **Application Build**: Compiles the single-file executable
5. **DLL Extraction Simulation**: Runs the extraction process
6. **Package Creation**: Includes extracted DLLs in deployment package

### Monitoring the Process

The script provides detailed output during execution:

```
==================== DLL EXTRACTION SIMULATION ====================
INFO: Target extraction path: C:\temp\WebConnect\extracted
INFO: Running DLL extraction simulation with: ./publish/WebConnect.exe
INFO: Extraction process completed in 2.34 seconds with exit code: 4
SUCCESS: Found extraction directory: 8e89e2c6a5d4... with 189 DLL files (85.68 MB)
SUCCESS: Successfully copied extracted DLLs to deployment package
```

## Understanding the Process

### Extraction Simulation Process

1. **Path Validation**: Verifies extraction directory accessibility and permissions
2. **Disk Space Check**: Ensures sufficient space for extraction
3. **Directory Preparation**: Creates extraction directory if needed
4. **Process Execution**: Runs the application with `--version` flag to trigger extraction
5. **Directory Enumeration**: Discovers extracted DLL directories
6. **DLL Cataloging**: Counts and measures extracted dependencies
7. **Package Integration**: Copies extracted DLLs to deployment package

### Output Structure

After successful extraction, the deployment package includes:

```
publish/
â”œâ”€â”€ WebConnect.exe                 # Main executable
â”œâ”€â”€ ExtractedDLLs/                   # Extracted dependencies
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 8e89e2c6a5d4.../            # Hash-based directory name
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Microsoft.Extensions.*.dll
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ System.*.dll
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ [other dependencies]
â””â”€â”€ [other deployment files]
```

### Exit Codes and Interpretation

| Exit Code | Meaning | Action Required |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| 0 | Success (version info displayed) | Normal - extraction successful |
| 4 | Configuration error (expected) | Normal - extraction still occurred |
| -2147450720 | Common .NET configuration warning | Normal - extraction still occurred |
| Other | Unexpected error | Review logs and troubleshoot |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Failed to create extraction directory"

**Symptoms:**
```
ERROR: Failed to create extraction directory: Access to the path 'C:\Program Files...' is denied.
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Change Extraction Path**: Use a writable directory
   ```powershell
   $env:DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR = "C:\temp\WebConnect\extracted"
   ```

2. **Run with Elevated Permissions**: Run PowerShell as Administrator

3. **Use Alternative Path**: Choose a path with appropriate permissions
   ```powershell
   $env:DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\WebConnect\extracted"
   ```

#### Issue: "No DLL extraction directories found"

**Symptoms:**
- Build completes without errors
- No extracted DLL directories in output
- Application works normally

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Application doesn't require extraction**: Some .NET applications embed all dependencies
2. **Different extraction path**: DLLs extracted to unexpected location
3. **Extraction disabled**: Application configuration prevents extraction

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Check if `DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR` is set correctly
2. Look for extraction directories in standard temp locations
3. Verify application is built as single-file executable

#### Issue: "Insufficient disk space"

**Symptoms:**
```
WARNING: Low disk space on extraction drive: 0.45 GB
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Free up disk space**: Remove unnecessary files from the target drive
2. **Change extraction path**: Use a drive with more available space
3. **Clean up previous extractions**: Remove old extraction directories

#### Issue: "Path too long"

**Symptoms:**
```
ERROR: Extraction path is too long (>248 characters): 267
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Shorten the path**: Use a shorter base directory
2. **Use path mapping**: Create a junction or symbolic link to a shorter path
3. **Enable long path support**: Configure Windows to support long paths (Windows 10+)
