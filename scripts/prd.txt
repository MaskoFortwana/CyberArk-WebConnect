# ChromeConnect Project Context
ChromeConnect is a Windows application that automates web portal authentication. It opens Google Chrome on a specified website, performs automated login by locating credential fields, and verifies login success. This is a C# rewrite of the existing Python-based WebConnect application.

## Core Features
1. Command-line interface matching the original WebConnect parameters (USR, PSW, URL, DOM, etc.)
2. Chrome browser automation using Selenium WebDriver
3. Multiple login field detection strategies for different websites
4. Secure credential handling
5. Login success/failure verification
6. Screenshot capture for failed logins
7. Human-like typing simulation
8. Standalone Windows executable (.exe) deployment

## Technical Architecture
- C# with .NET 8.0 
- Selenium WebDriver for Chrome automation
- Command-line argument parsing
- Browser manager for Chrome configuration and control
- Login detector for finding form elements
- Credential entry module for secure credential handling
- Login verification module for success/failure detection

## Development Roadmap
### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Set up project structure and references
- Implement basic command-line parsing
- Create browser management functionality

### Phase 2: Login Automation
- Implement login form detection
- Create credential entry with human-like typing
- Develop login success verification

### Phase 3: Error Handling and Logging
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement screenshot capture
- Create logging functionality

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
- Test with various login pages
- Optimize detection strategies
- Handle edge cases

### Phase 5: Packaging and Deployment
- Create self-contained executable
- Write documentation
- Prepare for distribution

## Logical Dependency Chain
1. Project structure and command-line parsing
2. Browser automation and control
3. Login form detection
4. Credential entry handling
5. Login success verification
6. Error handling and screenshot capture
7. Testing and refinement
8. Packaging and deployment

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Different login form structures across websites
  Mitigation: Implement multiple detection strategies

- Risk: Chrome version compatibility issues
  Mitigation: Use WebDriverManager for automatic driver management

- Risk: Security concerns with credential handling
  Mitigation: Implement secure credential management

- Risk: Error handling in various network conditions
  Mitigation: Comprehensive error handling and timeouts
