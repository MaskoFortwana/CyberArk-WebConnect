      "taskTitle": "Test with various login pages",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the login page testing task into subtasks that cover each authentication type (standard, multi-step, AJAX, SSO, CAPTCHA), with specific test case development, mock implementation, and automation requirements for each",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a comprehensive test suite for multiple authentication mechanisms, requiring both automated and manual testing approaches. The complexity is high due to the variety of login scenarios, need for mock implementations, and integration with different security measures. The code example shows significant technical depth with dependency injection and multiple test components."

      "taskTitle": "Optimize detection strategies",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the detection strategy optimization task into subtasks covering analysis of failure patterns, enhancement of specific detection methods (selectors, attributes, fuzzy matching, shadow DOM), implementation of scoring systems, and performance optimization techniques",
      "reasoning": "This task requires sophisticated algorithm development with a scoring system for detection reliability. The complexity is very high due to the need for machine learning approaches, fuzzy matching, and handling of diverse web page structures. The code example shows complex detection logic with multiple fallback strategies and detailed attribute analysis."

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for each special login scenario (2FA, CAPTCHA, multi-step, popups, iFrames, JavaScript-heavy pages, session handling), with specific implementation requirements, configuration options, and graceful degradation approaches for each case",
      "reasoning": "This task deals with numerous edge cases that require specialized handling techniques. The complexity is very high due to the unpredictable nature of these scenarios and the need for robust error handling. The implementation requires deep browser automation knowledge to handle iFrames, popups, and complex JavaScript interactions."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the executable packaging task into subtasks covering project configuration for self-contained deployment, WebDriver bundling strategy, installation script development, and package optimization techniques",
      "reasoning": "This task involves packaging the application as a standalone executable with proper configuration. The complexity is moderate as it primarily involves configuration and build process setup rather than complex algorithm development. The main challenges are ensuring all dependencies are properly bundled and optimizing the package size."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the documentation task into subtasks covering basic usage documentation (README, installation), technical documentation (architecture, configuration), example creation for common scenarios, and error/troubleshooting documentation",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on creating comprehensive documentation and usage examples. The complexity is moderate as it requires thorough understanding of the application but doesn't involve complex technical implementation. The main challenge is ensuring completeness and clarity across different documentation components."
