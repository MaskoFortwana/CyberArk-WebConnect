# Task ID: 5
# Title: Update PowerShell Deployment Scripts
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify deployment scripts to include DLL extraction simulation and environment variable setup.
# Details:
The task has been completed with the following implementation:

1. **Created new PowerShell deployment script** (`deploy.ps1`) with comprehensive features:
   - **Environment Variable Setup**: Implemented `Set-ExtractionEnvironmentVariable` function that sets `DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR` at machine level using `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable()`
   - **DLL Extraction Simulation**: Added `Invoke-DllExtractionSimulation` function that calls `ExtractDlls.ps1`
   - **Extracted DLL Structure Copy**: Implemented `Copy-ExtractedDllStructure` function that copies from `$env:DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR\*` to `$deploymentPackagePath\ExtractedDlls`
   - **Validation Function**: Added `Validate-Extraction` function that checks for the hash-based directory `BUVKQZGVGMYJUEVNC62UH0NUC1GYHEG=`

2. **Additional deployment features implemented**:
   - Prerequisites validation with clear error messages
   - Comprehensive deployment of ChromeConnect executable and supporting files
   - Directory structure creation (logs, screenshots, ExtractedDlls)
   - Environment testing and validation
   - Detailed deployment summary with status reporting
   - Parameter-driven configuration (can disable features for testing)

# Test Strategy:
The script has been tested successfully with the following validations:

1. Deployment works with and without DLL extraction simulation
2. Environment variable setup (requires admin privileges for machine-level)
3. All validation functions working correctly
4. Extracted DLL structure copying implemented and tested
5. Complete deployment package created with proper directory structure

Additional testing recommendations:
1. Test in various environments to ensure consistent behavior
2. Verify performance with large deployment packages
3. Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
