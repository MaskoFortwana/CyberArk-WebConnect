# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Testing Procedures
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and implement testing procedures to ensure the build process and DLL extraction work correctly.
# Details:
1. Create a new PowerShell script named Test-BuildAndExtraction.ps1.
2. Implement the following test cases:
   a. Test environment variable setting
   b. Verify build process completes without errors
   c. Check DLL extraction to custom directory
   d. Validate application functionality with new DLL location
   e. Test on a clean machine without pre-existing temp extractions
3. Add assertions for each test case:
   function Assert-Condition($condition, $message) {
       if (-not $condition) {
           throw "Assertion failed: $message"
       }
   }
4. Implement each test case, for example:
   function Test-EnvironmentVariable {
       Assert-Condition ($env:DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR -eq "C:\Program Files (x86)\CyberArk\PSM\Components\ChromeConnect") "Environment variable not set correctly"
   }
5. Run all tests and report results.

# Test Strategy:
1. Execute Test-BuildAndExtraction.ps1 on both development and clean test machines.
2. Verify all test cases pass without any assertion failures.
3. Manually review the test results and logs.
4. Ensure no real websites are accessed during testing.
