# Task ID: 2
# Title: Modify Publish Script for DLL Extraction
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the existing publish.ps1 script to include extraction directory setup and simulate first-run extraction during build.
# Details:
1. Open the existing publish.ps1 script.
2. Add a new function to simulate DLL extraction:
   function Simulate-DllExtraction {
       $extractPath = $env:DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR
       if (-not (Test-Path $extractPath)) {
           New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $extractPath -Force
       }
       # Run the application with a flag to trigger DLL extraction
       & .\ChromeConnect.exe --extract-dlls
   }
3. Call the Simulate-DllExtraction function after the publish step.
4. Add logic to copy the extracted DLL folder to the deployment package.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the modified publish script.
2. Verify that the DLL extraction simulation occurs.
3. Check if the extracted DLL folder is created in the correct location.
4. Ensure the extracted DLL folder is included in the deployment package.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement and Test DLL Extraction Simulation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refine the Simulate-DllExtraction function to properly trigger DLL extraction and verify the process works correctly.
### Details:
1. Update the Simulate-DllExtraction function to use appropriate environment variables for extraction path
2. Add proper error handling for the extraction process
3. Implement a verification step that confirms DLLs were actually extracted
4. Test the function with various scenarios (existing directory, non-existing directory)

Implementation of DLL extraction simulation completed with the following enhancements:

- Updated Simulate-DllExtraction function to use --version argument instead of --help for better extraction triggering
- Implemented comprehensive error handling for expected exit codes (-2147450720, 0, 4)
- Added robust verification with detailed logging of extracted DLLs
- Implemented recursive DLL searching with sample file name logging
- Enhanced directory creation with proper error handling
- Added fallback checks for .NET extraction directories in temp paths
- Fixed PowerShell Start-Process parameters to prevent output redirection conflicts

Testing confirmed the script successfully:
- Builds and runs DLL extraction simulation
- Handles all expected exit codes properly
- Creates extraction directory when needed
- Verifies extracted DLLs with appropriate logging
- Copies extracted DLL directories to deployment package
- Provides comprehensive logging throughout the process

The implementation includes robust error handling, comprehensive logging with different message types, automatic directory structure creation, DLL verification with sample file listing, and support for both environment variable and default extraction paths.

## 2. Implement Extracted DLL Packaging Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add logic to copy the extracted DLL folder to the deployment package and ensure it's properly structured.
### Details:
1. Determine the appropriate location in the deployment package for the extracted DLLs
2. Implement the copy operation with proper error handling
3. Add validation to ensure all required DLLs are included
4. Preserve file attributes and permissions during the copy process
<info added on 2025-05-28T15:38:08.179Z>
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED: The extracted DLL packaging logic has been successfully implemented in the Simulate-DllExtraction function within publish.ps1.

Key implementation details:
- DLL extraction directories are copied to $OutputDir/ExtractedDLLs/[hash-directory-name]
- Proper directory structure is maintained with recursive copy operation
- Error handling includes try-catch blocks with detailed logging
- Destination directory creation ensures parent directory exists before copying
- Success messages confirm when extracted DLLs are copied to deployment package

Code location: Lines 354-365 in publish.ps1
- Creates destination path: "$OutputDir/ExtractedDLLs/$($dir.Name)"
- Uses Copy-Item with -Recurse -Force flags for complete directory copy
- Provides comprehensive error handling and user feedback

The packaging logic successfully integrates with the DLL extraction simulation, ensuring that any extracted DLL directories are properly included in the deployment package for AppLocker compatibility.

## 3. Add Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Enhance the publish script with robust error handling and detailed logging for the DLL extraction process.
### Details:
1. Implement try-catch blocks around critical operations
2. Add detailed logging for each step of the extraction and packaging process
3. Create specific error messages for common failure scenarios
4. Implement a cleanup routine for failed extractions
5. Add a summary log of the extraction process results
<info added on 2025-05-28T15:39:47.644Z>
Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging in the Simulate-DllExtraction function with:

- Extraction summary tracking system with timing, status, and statistics
- Robust input validation including path length, null checks, and disk space verification
- Enhanced directory management with permission testing and validation
- Process execution monitoring with timing and detailed exit code handling
- File operation safeguards with accessibility checks and post-copy verification
- Error recovery mechanisms with cleanup routines for failed operations
- Detailed summary reporting with color-coded status tables and statistics
- Exception handling architecture with inner exception logging and finally blocks

All critical operations now have try-catch protection with specific error messages for common failure scenarios, and the cleanup routine successfully handles partial extractions.

## 4. Document Script Changes and Create Usage Guide [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Document all changes made to the publish script and create a comprehensive guide for using the DLL extraction feature.
### Details:
1. Add detailed comments to the script explaining the DLL extraction process
2. Create a separate markdown document describing the purpose and usage of the extraction feature
3. Document any environment variables or configuration settings required
4. Include troubleshooting steps for common issues
5. Add examples of successful extraction scenarios
