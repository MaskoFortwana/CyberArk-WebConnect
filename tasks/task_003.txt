# Task ID: 3
# Title: Enhance Build Process
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the build process to maintain single-file deployment and include DLL extraction step.
# Details:
1. Review the existing .csproj file.
2. Ensure the following setting is present and unchanged:
   <IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract>true</IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract>
3. Add a post-build event to trigger DLL extraction:
   <Target Name="PostBuild" AfterTargets="PostBuildEvent">
     <Exec Command="powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $(ProjectDir)ExtractDlls.ps1" />
   </Target>
4. Create ExtractDlls.ps1 script to handle DLL extraction simulation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run a full build process.
2. Verify that the single-file deployment is still generated.
3. Check if the DLL extraction occurs during the build.
4. Ensure the extracted DLLs are included in the output directory.
