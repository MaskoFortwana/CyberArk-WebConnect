# Task ID: 9
# Title: Convert ChromeConnect to Regular Multi-File Deployment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor ChromeConnect deployment from single-file bundle to a standard multi-file deployment with a two-tier structure where ChromeConnect.exe is deployed to the parent directory and all supporting files to a subdirectory, removing PublishSingleFile configuration and ensuring all .NET runtime assemblies are deployed correctly.
# Details:
1. Remove all <PublishSingleFile> and related single-file publishing properties from the ChromeConnect .csproj and any Directory.Build.props or publish profiles. 2. Update all publish profiles to ensure 'PublishSingleFile' is false and that all required .NET runtime assemblies, dependencies, and configuration files are copied to the output directory. 3. Modify build and deployment scripts to implement a two-tier deployment structure: place ChromeConnect.exe in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\CyberArk\PSM\Components\' and all supporting files (.NET assemblies, dependencies, configuration) in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\CyberArk\PSM\Components\ChromeConnect\'. 4. Configure the application to properly locate its dependencies in the ChromeConnect subfolder at runtime. 5. Ensure the application is published as a self-contained or framework-dependent deployment as required, but not as a single-file bundle. 6. Validate that no .NET assemblies (e.g., System.Private.CoreLib.dll) are extracted to temp directories at runtime, eliminating AppLocker DLL extraction issues. 7. Remove any logic related to DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR or DLL extraction simulation from scripts and documentation. 8. Update any references in documentation or scripts that assume a single-file deployment.

# Test Strategy:
1. Publish ChromeConnect using the updated configuration and verify that ChromeConnect.exe is placed in the parent directory while all .NET runtime assemblies and dependencies are present in the ChromeConnect subdirectory. 2. Deploy to a clean test environment and confirm that the application runs without extracting files to a temp directory. 3. Use tools like Process Monitor to ensure no runtime DLL extraction occurs and that the application correctly loads dependencies from the subfolder. 4. Attempt to launch the application with AppLocker enabled and verify that System.Private.CoreLib.dll and other assemblies are loaded directly from the ChromeConnect install subdirectory. 5. Confirm that all build and deployment scripts function correctly with the new two-tier structure and no longer reference single-file or extraction logic.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Remove Single-File Publishing Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Eliminate all <PublishSingleFile> and related single-file publishing properties from ChromeConnect's .csproj, Directory.Build.props, and publish profiles.
### Details:
Edit project and configuration files to remove any references to single-file publishing, ensuring that PublishSingleFile is set to false everywhere and no related properties remain.

## 2. Update Publish Profiles for Multi-File Deployment [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Modify all publish profiles to ensure multi-file deployment, copying all required .NET runtime assemblies, dependencies, and configuration files to the output directory.
### Details:
Ensure publish profiles are configured for either self-contained or framework-dependent deployment as required, but not as a single-file bundle. Confirm all necessary files are included in the output.

## 3. Revise Build and Deployment Scripts for Two-Tier Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Update build and deployment scripts to implement the two-tier deployment structure required by CyberArk extensions.
### Details:
Modify scripts to place ChromeConnect.exe in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\CyberArk\PSM\Components\' and all supporting files (.NET assemblies, dependencies, configuration) in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\CyberArk\PSM\Components\ChromeConnect\'. Remove any logic related to DLL extraction or single-file deployment.

## 4. Remove Extraction Logic and Environment Variables [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Eliminate any code, script logic, or documentation referencing DOTNET_BUNDLE_EXTRACT_BASE_DIR or DLL extraction simulation.
### Details:
Search for and remove all references to bundle extraction logic and related environment variables in scripts, code, and documentation.

## 5. Update Documentation and Validate Deployment [done]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Update all documentation and deployment references to reflect multi-file deployment and validate that no .NET assemblies are extracted to temp directories at runtime.
### Details:
Revise documentation to remove single-file deployment references. Deploy the application and verify that all assemblies load from the target directory, not from temporary locations.

Validation Results: Multi-file deployment is working correctly. The publish script successfully creates the two-tier structure with ChromeConnect.exe in the parent directory and all supporting files in the ChromeConnect subdirectory. The build process no longer performs any DLL extraction or uses temporary directories - all assemblies are properly deployed as regular files.

However, testing revealed that ChromeConnect.exe cannot currently locate its dependencies (ChromeConnect.dll) in the subfolder, which is expected and will be addressed in subtask 9.6. The deployment structure itself is correct and ready for the runtime dependency resolution configuration.

## 6. Configure Runtime Dependency Resolution [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Implement configuration to ensure ChromeConnect.exe can locate its dependencies in the ChromeConnect subfolder at runtime.
### Details:
Add necessary configuration or code changes to ensure the application correctly resolves dependencies from the ChromeConnect subfolder when the main executable is in the parent directory. This may involve creating a .runtimeconfig.json file, using assembly binding redirects, or implementing custom assembly loading logic.

I've begun implementing runtime dependency resolution for our two-tier deployment structure. The core issue is that ChromeConnect.exe resides in the parent directory while ChromeConnect.dll and all other dependencies are in the ChromeConnect subdirectory, causing runtime errors.

Initial analysis confirms the error: "The application to execute does not exist: 'C:\projects\ChromeConnect\publish\ChromeConnect.dll'" - this occurs because the .NET runtime is searching for dependencies in the same directory as the executable.

I'm exploring four potential solutions:
1. Creating a ChromeConnect.runtimeconfig.json file in the parent directory with additionalProbingPaths to direct the runtime to check the subdirectory
2. Using app.config with runtime/assemblyBinding/probing privatePath settings
3. Implementing custom assembly loading logic
4. Leveraging .NET's newer directory structure support features

I'm starting with the runtimeconfig.json approach as it's the most standard solution for .NET 8 applications and should provide the cleanest implementation path.

<info added on 2025-05-29T13:56:20.350Z>
First Attempt Result: The additionalProbingPaths approach did not work. Created ChromeConnect.runtimeconfig.json in the parent directory with:

```json
{
  "runtimeOptions": {
    "additionalProbingPaths": ["ChromeConnect"]
  }
}
```

This still results in the same error: "The application to execute does not exist: 'C:\projects\ChromeConnect\publish\ChromeConnect.dll'"

Root Cause Analysis: The issue appears to be that .NET runtime is looking for the main application assembly (ChromeConnect.dll) specifically, not just dependencies. The additionalProbingPaths only works for dependency resolution, not for the main application assembly.

Next Approach: Need to try a different strategy. The issue might be that we need to modify the runtimeconfig.json to specify the actual application entry point correctly, or we might need to create a launcher/wrapper approach. I'll investigate:

1. Creating a small launcher executable in the parent directory that explicitly loads ChromeConnect.dll from the subdirectory
2. Using AssemblyLoadContext to programmatically control assembly loading
3. Modifying the build process to generate a proper executable structure that maintains the correct references
4. Exploring if app.config with assemblyBinding elements might provide more control than runtimeconfig.json

## 7. Create Custom Post-Publish Script for Two-Tier Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Develop a post-publish script that reorganizes the published output into the required two-tier structure.
### Details:
Create a script that runs after the publish operation to move ChromeConnect.exe to the parent directory while keeping all other files in the ChromeConnect subfolder. This script should be integrated into the build/CI pipeline.

Analysis of Current Implementation:

Found that there is already a post-build script `DeploymentStructure.ps1` integrated into the build process via MSBuild target in `ChromeConnect.csproj`. This script successfully creates the two-tier structure but results in a non-functional deployment because ChromeConnect.exe cannot locate ChromeConnect.dll in the subdirectory.

The fundamental issue is architectural: .NET self-contained applications expect their main assembly (ChromeConnect.dll) to be in the same directory as the executable (ChromeConnect.exe).

New Strategy - Launcher Approach:
Instead of trying to force the existing executable to work with separated dependencies, I should:

1. Keep the current ChromeConnect.exe and ChromeConnect.dll together in the ChromeConnect subdirectory 
2. Create a small launcher executable in the parent directory that:
   - Is named ChromeConnect.exe (what CyberArk expects)
   - Launches the real ChromeConnect.exe from the subdirectory
   - Passes through all command line arguments
   - Preserves exit codes and console output

This approach will satisfy both requirements:
- CyberArk gets ChromeConnect.exe in the expected location
- The .NET application works correctly with all its dependencies

Implementation Update - May 30, 2025:

First attempt to build the launcher failed with the following issues:

1. The launcher project `ChromeConnect.Launcher` doesn't exist yet in the solution
2. PowerShell deployment script error: "A positional parameter cannot be found that accepts argument 'ChromeConnect.Launcher'"
3. Path resolution in the build script is failing to locate the launcher project

Action Plan:
1. Create a new project `ChromeConnect.Launcher` in the solution
   - Implement as a minimal .NET console application
   - Configure to output a small executable that redirects to the main application
   - Ensure it handles command-line arguments and preserves exit codes

2. Fix the PowerShell script path resolution
   - Update parameter handling in DeploymentStructure.ps1
   - Ensure proper path resolution for both main app and launcher

3. Modify the build pipeline to:
   - Build both projects in correct order
   - Deploy the launcher to parent directory
   - Deploy the main application to subdirectory

4. Test the complete build and deployment process to verify the launcher correctly invokes the main application
