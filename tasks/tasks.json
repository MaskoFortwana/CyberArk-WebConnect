This may involve creating a .runtimeconfig.json file, using assembly binding redirects, or implementing custom assembly loading logic.\n<info added on 2025-05-29T13:55:40.558Z>\nI've begun implementing runtime dependency resolution for our two-tier deployment structure. The core issue is that ChromeConnect.exe resides in the parent directory while ChromeConnect.dll and all other dependencies are in the ChromeConnect subdirectory, causing runtime errors.\n\nInitial analysis confirms the error: \"The application to execute does not exist: 'C:\\projects\\ChromeConnect\\publish\\ChromeConnect.dll'\" - this occurs because the .NET runtime is searching for dependencies in the same directory as the executable.\n\nI'm exploring four potential solutions:\n1. Creating a ChromeConnect.runtimeconfig.json file in the parent directory with additionalProbingPaths to direct the runtime to check the subdirectory\n2. Using app.config with runtime/assemblyBinding/probing privatePath settings\n3. Implementing custom assembly loading logic\n4. Leveraging .NET's newer directory structure support features\n\nI'm starting with the runtimeconfig.json approach as it's the most standard solution for .NET 8 applications and should provide the cleanest implementation path.\n</info added on 2025-05-29T13:55:40.558Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-29T13:56:20.350Z>\nFirst Attempt Result: The additionalProbingPaths approach did not work. Created ChromeConnect.runtimeconfig.json in the parent directory with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runtimeOptions\": {\n    \"additionalProbingPaths\": [\"ChromeConnect\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis still results in the same error: \"The application to execute does not exist: 'C:\\projects\\ChromeConnect\\publish\\ChromeConnect.dll'\"\n\nRoot Cause Analysis: The issue appears to be that .NET runtime is looking for the main application assembly (ChromeConnect.dll) specifically, not just dependencies. The additionalProbingPaths only works for dependency resolution, not for the main application assembly.\n\nNext Approach: Need to try a different strategy. The issue might be that we need to modify the runtimeconfig.json to specify the actual application entry point correctly, or we might need to create a launcher/wrapper approach. I'll investigate:\n\n1. Creating a small launcher executable in the parent directory that explicitly loads ChromeConnect.dll from the subdirectory\n2. Using AssemblyLoadContext to programmatically control assembly loading\n3. Modifying the build process to generate a proper executable structure that maintains the correct references\n4. Exploring if app.config with assemblyBinding elements might provide more control than runtimeconfig.json\n</info added on 2025-05-29T13:56:20.350Z>",

This script successfully creates the two-tier structure but results in a non-functional deployment because ChromeConnect.exe cannot locate ChromeConnect.dll in the subdirectory.\n\nThe fundamental issue is architectural: .NET self-contained applications expect their main assembly (ChromeConnect.dll) to be in the same directory as the executable (ChromeConnect.exe).\n\nNew Strategy - Launcher Approach:\nInstead of trying to force the existing executable to work with separated dependencies, I should:\n\n1. Keep the current ChromeConnect.exe and ChromeConnect.dll together in the ChromeConnect subdirectory \n2. Create a small launcher executable in the parent directory that:\n   - Is named ChromeConnect.exe (what CyberArk expects)\n   - Launches the real ChromeConnect.exe from the subdirectory\n   - Passes through all command line arguments\n   - Preserves exit codes and console output\n\nThis approach will satisfy both requirements:\n- CyberArk gets ChromeConnect.exe in the expected location\n- The .NET application works correctly with all its dependencies\n</info added on 2025-05-29T13:57:03.864Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-29T14:00:04.826Z>\nImplementation Update - May 30, 2025:\n\nFirst attempt to build the launcher failed with the following issues:\n\n1.

PowerShell deployment script error: \"A positional parameter cannot be found that accepts argument 'ChromeConnect.Launcher'\"\n3. Path resolution in the build script is failing to locate the launcher project\n\nAction Plan:\n1. Create a new project `ChromeConnect.Launcher` in the solution\n   - Implement as a minimal .NET console application\n   - Configure to output a small executable that redirects to the main application\n   - Ensure it handles command-line arguments and preserves exit codes\n\n2. Fix the PowerShell script path resolution\n   - Update parameter handling in DeploymentStructure.ps1\n   - Ensure proper path resolution for both main app and launcher\n\n3. Modify the build pipeline to:\n   - Build both projects in correct order\n   - Deploy the launcher to parent directory\n   - Deploy the main application to subdirectory\n\n4.

Manual testing of critical scripts:\n   - Execute each critical PowerShell and batch script in a test environment\n   - Verify they run without errors\n   - Check logs for any unexpected behavior\n   - Confirm all paths are correctly resolved\n\n3. Build verification:\n   - Run a complete build using the updated build scripts\n   - Verify the build completes successfully\n   - Check that all artifacts are generated with correct naming\n\n4.

These references appear to be:\n1. Historical documentation of the rename process itself\n2. Build log analysis instructions mentioning both old and new names\n3. Task descriptions documenting the transition from ChromeConnect to WebConnect\n\n**Decision:**\nThese references are appropriate to keep as they serve as historical documentation of the project evolution and rename process. They don't affect the actual codebase or user-facing functionality.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo action needed - these task files serve as project history and the references provide context for the rename work completed.\n</info added on 2025-05-29T18:19:10.150Z>",
