# Task ID: 16
# Title: Git Operations and Repository Cleanup for WebConnect Renaming
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform Git operations to finalize the WebConnect renaming process, including using git mv commands to preserve history, updating .gitignore, cleaning old artifacts, and committing all changes with appropriate commit messages.
# Details:
1. Use Git mv Commands to Preserve History:
   - Use `git mv` instead of regular file system operations to ensure history preservation
   - Execute commands for any remaining directories that need renaming:
   ```bash
   git mv old-directory-name new-directory-name
   ```
   - Verify that history is preserved by checking git log on renamed files

2. Update .gitignore File:
   - Add entries to ignore old ChromeConnect artifacts:
   ```
   # Legacy ChromeConnect artifacts
   ChromeConnect-*.zip
   ChromeConnect.exe
   ```
   - Add or update entries for WebConnect artifacts:
   ```
   # WebConnect build artifacts
   WebConnect-*.zip
   ```
   - Ensure bin/obj directories are properly ignored:
   ```
   # Build directories
   **/bin/
   **/obj/
   ```

3. Clean Old Artifacts:
   - Remove any remaining ChromeConnect-*.zip files from the repository:
   ```bash
   git rm --cached ChromeConnect-*.zip
   ```
   - Clean bin/obj directories to remove old build artifacts:
   ```bash
   git clean -fdx --dry-run  # First run with dry-run to verify
   git clean -fdx            # Then execute the actual cleanup
   ```
   - Remove any other legacy files that are no longer needed

4. Verify Repository State:
   - Run `git status` to ensure all changes are tracked
   - Review the list of modified, added, and deleted files
   - Check for any untracked files that should be either added or ignored

5. Commit Changes with Appropriate Messages:
   - Create a detailed commit message that explains the repository cleanup:
   ```
   git commit -m "Complete WebConnect renaming: Repository cleanup and structure finalization
   
   - Updated .gitignore to handle WebConnect artifacts
   - Removed legacy ChromeConnect artifacts
   - Cleaned build directories
   - Used git mv to preserve history for remaining renames
   - Final repository structure adjustments for WebConnect"
   ```

6. Create a Tag for the Completed Renaming Process:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0-webconnect-rename -m "Completed WebConnect renaming process"
   git push origin v1.0.0-webconnect-rename
   ```

7. Update Branch Protection Rules (if applicable):
   - If using GitHub or similar platforms, update any branch protection rules that might reference old file paths or naming conventions

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify History Preservation:
   - Select 3-5 key files that were renamed using git mv
   - Run `git log --follow -- new-file-name` for each file
   - Confirm that the history shows commits from before the renaming

2. Validate .gitignore Configuration:
   - Create test files matching the patterns in .gitignore (e.g., create a dummy ChromeConnect-1.0.0.zip file)
   - Run `git status` and verify these files are not tracked
   - Create build artifacts in bin/obj directories and verify they are ignored

3. Confirm Artifact Cleanup:
   - Verify no ChromeConnect-*.zip files remain in the repository
   - Check that bin/obj directories are clean of old build artifacts
   - Ensure no legacy ChromeConnect executables remain in the repository

4. Repository Structure Validation:
   - Create a directory listing of the entire repository structure
   - Verify all directories follow the WebConnect naming convention
   - Confirm no ChromeConnect-named directories or files remain (unless intentionally preserved)

5. Build and Run Tests:
   - Perform a clean build of the project
   - Run the full test suite to ensure the repository cleanup hasn't affected functionality
   - Verify the build produces WebConnect artifacts with correct naming

6. Git History Verification:
   - Review the commit history to ensure the cleanup commit is properly documented
   - Verify the tag for the completed renaming process exists
   - Pull the repository to a new location and confirm all changes are properly reflected

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify and execute git mv commands for remaining directories [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify all remaining directories that need to be renamed as part of the WebConnect renaming process and use git mv to preserve history.
### Details:
1. Create a list of all directories still using the old ChromeConnect naming
2. For each directory, use `git mv old-directory-name new-directory-name`
3. Check that the directory structure is updated correctly
4. Run `git status` to verify the changes are properly tracked

## Analysis Results
- Directory rename analysis complete
- ChromeConnect.Console -> WebConnect.Console rename is already staged in git
- No other directories with ChromeConnect naming were found that need renaming
- Directory structure appears to be properly updated
- Git status confirms changes are being tracked correctly
- Ready to proceed to .gitignore updates

## 2. Update .gitignore file with WebConnect entries [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the .gitignore file to include entries for WebConnect artifacts and remove references to ChromeConnect.
### Details:
1. Open the .gitignore file
2. Add entries to ignore old ChromeConnect artifacts
3. Add entries for WebConnect artifacts

<info added on 2025-05-29T17:18:53.452Z>
Successfully updated .gitignore file with the following changes:
- Added explicit ChromeConnect artifact entries (ChromeConnect-*.zip, ChromeConnect.exe, ChromeConnect-*.exe)
- Added WebConnect build artifact entries (WebConnect-*.zip, WebConnect-*.exe)
- Added additional bin/obj directory coverage (**/bin/, **/obj/)
- Removed incorrect Task Master entries that were preventing tracking of tasks/ and tasks.json

## 8. Update branch protection rules and CI/CD configurations [done]
### Dependencies: 16.6, 16.7
### Description: Update any branch protection rules, CI/CD configurations, or other repository settings that might reference old file paths or naming conventions.
### Details:
1. Review branch protection rules in GitHub/GitLab settings
2. Update any path references from ChromeConnect to WebConnect
3. Check CI/CD configuration files (.github/workflows, azure-pipelines.yml, etc.)
4. Update any build scripts that might still reference old paths
5. Test that CI/CD pipelines run correctly with the new structure
<info added on 2025-05-29T17:33:06.762Z>
**CI/CD Configuration Analysis Results:**

1. **Repository Structure Check:**
   - ✅ Searched for `.github` directory - does not exist
   - ✅ Searched for `azure-pipelines.yml` files - not found  
   - ✅ Searched for `*.yml` and `*.yaml` files - none found
   - ✅ Searched for common CI/CD configuration patterns - none exist

2. **Documentation References:**
   - Found references to CI/CD configurations in task documentation (tasks.json, task files)
   - These are template/example references for future CI/CD setup, not actual configurations
   - Documentation in `docs/usage-examples.md` contains example GitHub Actions and Azure Pipeline configurations

3. **Current Repository State:**
   - This repository does not currently have any active CI/CD configurations
   - No `.github/workflows` directory
   - No Azure DevOps pipeline files
   - No Jenkins, CircleCI, or other CI/CD configuration files

4. **Actions Taken:**
   - ✅ Comprehensive search performed for CI/CD files
   - ✅ Verified no existing CI/CD configurations need updating for WebConnect renaming
   - ✅ All documentation references are already using WebConnect naming or are examples

**Conclusion:**
Since there are no actual CI/CD configuration files in the repository that reference ChromeConnect paths or naming, no updates are required for this subtask. The repository is ready for future CI/CD setup with the correct WebConnect naming already established.
