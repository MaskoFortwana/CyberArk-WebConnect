   ```

5. Add a detailed section on AppLocker rules:
   ```markdown
   ## AppLocker Rules
   
   WebConnect requires specific AppLocker rules to function properly in restricted environments. The following rules should be configured:

   ### Executable Rules
   ```xml
   <FilePathRule Id="..." Name="Allow WebConnect" Description="..." UserOrGroupSid="..." Action="Allow">
     <Conditions>
       <FilePathCondition Path="C:\Program Files (x86)\CyberArk\PSM\Components\WebConnect\*" />
     </Conditions>
   </FilePathRule>
   ```

   ### DLL Rules
   ```xml
   <FilePathRule Id="..." Name="Allow WebConnect DLLs" Description="..." UserOrGroupSid="..." Action="Allow">
     <Conditions>
       <FilePathCondition Path="C:\Program Files (x86)\CyberArk\PSM\Components\WebConnect\*" />
     </Conditions>
   </FilePathRule>
   ```
   ```

6. Remove all outdated sections that no longer apply to the WebConnect functionality, including:
   - Any references to ChromeConnect
   - Manual WebFormFields configuration instructions
   - Legacy deployment methods
   - Deprecated features

7. Update all code examples, configuration snippets, and command references to reflect the current WebConnect naming and functionality.

8. Add a section explaining the transition from manual configuration to automatic detection:
   ```markdown
   ## Automatic Field Detection vs. Manual Configuration
   
   WebConnect eliminates the need for manual WebFormFields configuration by implementing advanced field detection algorithms. This section explains how the automatic detection works and when you might need to use custom selectors for edge cases.
   ```

9. Include troubleshooting guidance specific to the automatic field detection and login verification features.

# Test Strategy:
1. Perform a comprehensive review of the updated README.md:
   - Verify all sections are present and properly formatted
   - Ensure all references to ChromeConnect have been replaced with WebConnect
   - Confirm the document clearly explains WebConnect as a CyberArk connection component
   - Validate that the automatic field detection and login verification features are prominently highlighted

2. Technical validation:
   - Verify all configuration parameters are accurately documented
   - Ensure AppLocker rule examples are correct and follow best practices
   - Confirm all paths and file references match the actual deployment structure

3. Usability testing:
   - Have a team member unfamiliar with the project read the README and verify they understand:
     - What WebConnect does
     - How it integrates with CyberArk
     - The benefits of automatic field detection
     - How to configure and deploy the component

4. Documentation consistency check:
   - Cross-reference with other project documentation to ensure consistency
   - Verify that terminology is used consistently throughout all documents
   - Ensure all links to other documentation or external resources are working

5. Markdown rendering test:
   - Preview the README.md in GitHub to ensure proper rendering of:
     - Tables
     - Code blocks
     - Headers and formatting
     - Links

6. Final validation:
   - Have a CyberArk integration specialist review the document for technical accuracy
