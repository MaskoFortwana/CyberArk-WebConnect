# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Directory Structure Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and manage the target directory for DLL extraction, including hash-based subdirectories.
# Details:
Successfully implemented directory structure management in both ExtractDlls.ps1 and publish.ps1 scripts with the following components:

1. **Enhanced ExtractDlls.ps1 script** with directory structure management:
   - Added `Cleanup-OldExtractions` function that removes extraction directories older than 7 days
   - Added `Set-DirectoryPermissions` function to enable inheritance from parent directory 
   - Added `Initialize-ExtractionDirectory` function to create base directory and hash-based subdirectories
   - Replaced simple directory creation with comprehensive directory management
   - Hash-based subdirectory name: 'BUVKQZGVGMYJUEVNC62UH0NUC1GYHEG=' (simulating .NET extraction behavior)

2. **Enhanced publish.ps1 script** with the same directory management functions:
   - Added the same three management functions (Cleanup-OldExtractions, Set-DirectoryPermissions, Initialize-ExtractionDirectory)
   - Updated Simulate-DllExtraction to use Initialize-ExtractionDirectory instead of simple New-Item
   - Comprehensive directory structure setup with permissions inheritance and cleanup

Implementation details:
- Directory structure management functions handle permission failures gracefully
- Cleanup function removes extraction directories older than 7 days
- Permissions inheritance is set up for AppLocker compatibility
- Hash-based subdirectory creation simulates .NET extraction behavior

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the directory management script.
2. Verify that the target directory and hash-based subdirectory are created.
3. Check if permissions are correctly inherited from the parent folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\CyberArk\PSM\Components\ChromeConnect).
4. Verify that the inheritance settings are properly configured for AppLocker compatibility.
5. Test the cleanup function with some dummy old folders.
6. Verify that permission warnings for "C:\Program Files (x86)" directory are expected and handled gracefully.
7. Confirm that both ExtractDlls.ps1 and publish.ps1 scripts implement the directory management functions consistently.
