## 6. Scan for Remaining ChromeConnect References [done]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Thoroughly search all code, configuration, and documentation for any remaining references to ChromeConnect.
### Details:
Use PowerShell to scan for ChromeConnect references: 'Get-ChildItem -Path . -Recurse -File | Select-String -Pattern "ChromeConnect" | Format-Table Path,LineNumber,Line -AutoSize'. Check registry entries for correct naming. Verify configuration files contain only WebConnect references. Check all URLs and endpoints for correct naming.
<info added on 2025-05-29T18:19:10.150Z>
Completed scan for ChromeConnect references:

**Found References:**
- task_005.txt, task_017.txt, task_009.txt, task_015.txt, task_014.txt

**Analysis:**
All references are in task documentation files within the tasks/ directory. These references appear to be:
1. Historical documentation of the rename process itself
2. Build log analysis instructions mentioning both old and new names
3. Task descriptions documenting the transition from ChromeConnect to WebConnect

**Decision:**
These references are appropriate to keep as they serve as historical documentation of the project evolution and rename process. They don't affect the actual codebase or user-facing functionality.

**Recommendation:**
No action needed - these task files serve as project history and the references provide context for the rename work completed.
